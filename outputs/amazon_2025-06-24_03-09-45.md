What One Medical members are saying
“I love One Medical. Blew my mind that I spent my entire appointment with my doctor, vs. sitting alone in a cold room for 20 min after a nurse takes vitals, only to see my doc for 1-2 min. Truly a revolutionary experience.”
– Member at New York, NY
“[One Medical] makes getting care so so easy when it was always difficult and prevented me from being proactive in the past.”
– Member at Austin, TX
“Just had my first annual medical check-up with @onemedical and it was a 10/10 experience: great app, easy new patient intake flow, nice facilities, excellent quality of care. Would be good to see them expand into more countries!”
– Member at Chicago, IL
“The service at @onemedical is consistently 5 star quality. It’s never been more convenient or more comfortable to obtain care.”
– Member at New York, NY
“I'm 30 years old and just now found a primary care that gave me an all around great experience. I genuinely felt heard - given resources and personal recommendations for any next steps. I only saw the doctor I chose, which greeted me from the waiting room and brought me back herself.”
– Member at Atlanta, GA
“I love One Medical so much. It's one of the services that has improved my life the most. They make getting care so so easy when it was always difficult and prevented me from being proactive in the past.”

## **You may be wondering**
### Getting started
What is Amazon One Medical?
Amazon One Medical is a modern approach to medical care—allowing people to get care on their terms, on their schedule. One Medical offers convenient [_scheduled visits_](https://health.amazon.com/onemedical/service-areas) at office locations near you, with same and next-day appointments available for members and patients. With [_membership_](https://health.amazon.com/prime), you can unlock on-demand 24/7 virtual care and ongoing support through our app for just $9/mo or $99/yr with Prime. Patients can also try a single virtual visit for 30+ common conditions with our [_Pay-per-visit_](https://health.amazon.com/onemedical/ppv?ref_=aom_nav_ppv_lp) option.
How is One Medical Membership different from Amazon One Medical Pay-per-visit? Which should I choose?
Amazon One Medical offers scheduled visits for members and patients, as well as additional care options to suit your lifestyle: become a member for comprehensive primary care and 24/7 support, or select our Pay-per-visit service for quick, one-time virtual care.
**Membership** provides on-demand virtual care nationwide for ongoing support of healthcare needs, and a differentiated primary care experience if you live near a One Medical office. One Medical members can use the One Medical app to access 24/7 on-demand virtual care at no extra cost, including Urgent Video Chats. They can also use the app to message with their providers, easily request prescription refills and renewals, access their health records and care plans, and book same and next-day appointments for remote or in-person visits. Scheduled visits are billed to you or your insurance, with most [_major insurance plans accepted_](https://www.onemedical.com/insurance/prime-members/?utm_source=amazon&utm_medium=ins_main&utm_content=link). One Medical memberships can be purchased by Prime members for $9/mo or $99/yr for the first member and $6/mo or $66/yr for each additional family member (maximum 5). If you're not a Prime member, One Medical memberships are available at [_OneMedical.com_](https://www.onemedical.com/) for $199/yr.
**Pay-per-visit** provides fast, convenient treatment for 30+ common health conditions through one-time virtual visits. With Pay-per-visit, you pay an out-of-pocket fee* starting at $29 for a messaging only visit or $49 for a video visit (*Prices vary by condition and visit type. Prices subject to change. Messaging only visits are not available in some states). If you don’t live near a One Medical office or if you already have a primary care provider, but you need a quick, one-time virtual visit for a common condition, Pay-per-visit may be a good option for you.
What makes One Medical different from other primary care and urgent care practices?
One Medical's philosophy is built on three core principles: quality care, patient-centered design, and smart application of technology. To deliver exceptional healthcare, from preventive medicine to acute care and chronic condition management, One Medical provides medical professionals the time and tools they need to make the best decisions for your health.
Each primary care provider focuses on building trusting relationships, taking the time to understand your unique health story and how your lifestyle affects your overall well-being. Our providers see fewer patients each day than typical primary care practices, allowing them to spend more time with you as your long-term healthcare advocates, partnering with you to manage health issues and navigate complex medical decisions. By using diagnostic tests appropriately and avoiding over diagnosis or unnecessary prescriptions, they empower you to make positive changes in your health and your life with newfound knowledge, support, and guidance. One Medical stays connected to your care journey, providing guidance and support even after you leave the office.

Does a One Medical Membership come with my Amazon Prime Membership?
No, One Medical Membership is not included as part of an Amazon Prime Membership, but can be purchased by an Amazon Prime member for an additional $9/mo or $99/yr for the first member and $6/mo or $66/yr for up to five additional members (an exclusive discount price for Prime members). [_Terms apply_](http://health.amazon.com/prime/onemedical/terms).

### Pricing, payment, and insurance
I purchased a One Medical Membership through my Prime account. How do I connect my Prime pricing to my One Medical account?
Locate and open the purchase confirmation email that was sent to the primary email address of your Prime account (don't forget to check the spam folder). The email will include options to either create a new One Medical account or apply your Prime pricing to an existing One Medical account. If you're unable to locate the purchase confirmation email, visit the [_membership management page_](https://health.amazon.com/prime/onemedical/settings/members) and follow the on-screen prompts.
Why is there a membership fee?
The One Medical Membership fee covers One Medical’s on-demand virtual care services on the One Medical app, as well as high-touch and value-added personal services such as insurance navigation and referral management. The on-demand virtual services are accessible through the One Medical app, featuring 24/7/365 on-demand video chats, secure provider messaging, “Treat Me Now” assessments for common health concerns, easy vaccine and medical record access, prescription renewals, and proactive reminders for follow-up care and referral needs.
The membership fee is not a covered benefit under most health insurance plans.
One Medical is dedicated to serving its community members, regardless of their financial means. Payment of the membership fee is not a prerequisite for receiving medical care in One Medical oﬃces.
Financial assistance is not applicable towards services rendered by outside facilities such as labs, specialist facilities, imaging facilities, etc. Learn more about options for accessing medical services at One Medical without payment of the annual membership fee on the One Medical website.

### Care
How do I get care with One Medical?
One Medical members and patients can book appointments at any of the offices across the US. We recommend checking with One Medical’s oﬃce prior to making an appointment to ensure your insurance plan is accepted at the oﬃce you plan to visit, as this might vary based on location.
[Learn more about One Medical office locations](https://www.onemedical.com/locations/?utm_source=amazon&utm_medium=locations_faq&utm_content=link)
If you don’t have a One Medical location nearby, you can still benefit from a One Medical Membership. You'll be able to get care right from your phone, 24/7, with on-demand care nationwide via Urgent Video Chat or Treat Me Now at no extra cost.
Depending on your location, there may be a requirement that One Medical first see you over video (or in person) before One Medical can provide care to you via Treat Me Now.
Does One Medical offer pediatric care for my kids?
Yes, One Medical offers [_Pediatric Services_](https://www.onemedical.com/services/kids/) (newborn - 17 years old) in several of our office locations. Please visit our [_locations page_](https://www.onemedical.com/locations/?utm_source=amazon&utm_medium=locations_faq&utm_content=link) to find out if we have a Pediatric office location near you.
I’m 65+ years and on Medicare. Does One Medical have an oﬀering for me?
One Medical provides comprehensive primary care for seniors on Medicare who can receive care in-person. Learn more about One Medical's primary care for seniors.
[Learn more about One Medical's primary care for seniors](https://www.onemedical.com/sixty-five-plus/?utm_source=amazon&utm_medium=seniors_faq&utm_content=link)
I only have Medicaid. Can I receive care from One Medical?
Except for residents of Washington, DC, One Medical cannot care for individuals only on Medicaid.
Can One Medical providers write a prescription for my condition?
One Medical has experience with a wide variety of conditions, including chronic condition management. If your One Medical provider determines that a prescription is appropriate as part of your course of treatment, your provider will send it electronically to your preferred pharmacy, including Amazon Pharmacy if you so choose. If you have an existing prescription, you can submit a request to have it renewed through the renewal request tool within your One Medical online account or the One Medical mobile app after you become a One Medical member.
