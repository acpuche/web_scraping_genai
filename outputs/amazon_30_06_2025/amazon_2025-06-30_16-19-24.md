By choosing 'Continue to application,' you confirm that you have read all the information about the Amazon Secured Card.
The **Amazon Secured Card** is built for people who are new to credit, or who would like to rebuild their credit.
This card has no annual fee, can be used at Amazon.com and Amazon physical stores, and your payment activity is reported to major credit bureaus to help you build a credit history. With the card you will also have access to your credit score, along with tools, guidance and tips to help you improve your credit.
This unique account initially requires an upfront deposit like a secured credit card, but will provide you an opportunity to convert into a traditional credit card with no deposit required, based on responsible credit usage and eligibility criteria.
![Step 1](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/credit/img20/PLCC/Secured/landingpage/SC_DP_S1_NP._CB659301611_.png)
If approved, you’ll first be required to provide a security deposit to activate the **Secured Card features**. You can deposit, in $50 increments, anywhere between $100 and the amount you're approved for (Maximum: $1000).
You can always choose to pay off your balance and then close your account, and your security deposit will be refunded.
![Step 2](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/credit/img20/PLCC/Secured/landingpage/SC_DP_S2_NP._CB659301611_.png)
After 12 months of responsibly building your credit, you may be eligible based on your credit profile to opt-in to activate the **Store Card features** of your account. Your account will continue to have no annual fee, and you will receive your security deposit back less what may be required to pay off your existing Secured Card features balance.
The choice to convert will always be 100% yours.

Frequently asked questions
[ What is a "secured credit card?" ](javascript:void\(0\))
A secured credit card operates much like other credit cards in that with responsible use, you can build or rebuild your credit. But secured credit cards differ in that they require a security deposit to be submitted to the bank which is held as collateral for the account. Whether you’re new to credit or looking to expand your credit knowledge, we’re here to help you continue learning on your credit journey.

[ Why do I need a deposit and how does it work? ](javascript:void\(0\))
Unlike other credit cards, the Amazon Secured Card requires an initial deposit which equals your credit limit, in order to activate the Secured Card features. For example, if you are approved to receive a $750 credit limit, you can choose to submit a deposit between $100 and $750. If you deposit $550, your credit limit when using the card is $550. This deposit must be submitted to Synchrony Bank and will be held in a security deposit account in order to start using the card. Your security deposit will be refunded if you choose to pay off your balance and then close your account. 
[ Can I get my deposit back? ](javascript:void\(0\))
Yes, your deposit can be returned to you in several ways, all as per your account terms. If your account is closed for any reason, Synchrony Bank will return your deposit funds minus any amount needed to pay off existing balances. If you choose to activate the Store Card features, your deposit will be returned to you minus the amount needed to pay off any: 
  1. Existing non-promotional balance on the Secured Card features.

  3. Remaining minimum payments due on the account if not covered by 1 and 2.


[ What is the difference between the Amazon Secured Card and Debit or Prepaid Cards? ](javascript:void\(0\))
Unlike a debit card or a prepaid card, the Amazon Secured Card is an actual credit card. You need to make monthly payments on your balance by the payment due date. Please know that although you must pay at least the minimum payment due each month, you can always choose to pay the full statement balance or any amount in between. Synchrony Bank reports your credit activity to the major credit bureaus-providing the opportunity to build your credit, with responsible use. 
[ If I choose to convert to the Store Card features, am I applying for a new credit card? ](javascript:void\(0\))
No, you are not. The Store Card features are included in the terms of your Amazon Secured Card account. After 12 months of being an account holder, Synchrony Bank will determine if you’re eligible to convert to the Store Card features of the account, and if so, Amazon will notify you of this option. If you choose to opt in to convert to the Store Card features, the Secured Card features will be permanently disabled. 
[ How are customer reviews used? ](javascript:void\(0\))
Amazon and Synchrony Bank use customer reviews about the Store Card and Secured Card to improve customer experience and address complaints, and cardholders posting reviews may be identified to Synchrony Bank for this purpose. For more information on how information about you is used and shared by Amazon, please see the [ Amazon.com Privacy Notice. ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/cs/help?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ) For more information about customer reviews, please see [ Understanding Customer Reviews and Ratings. ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/cs/help?nodeId=G8UYX7LALQC8V9KA)

Special financing and equal monthly payments offers may apply to purchases made using a Store Card.

We may, from time to time at our discretion, provide a % back benefit to Amazon Store Cardholders for certain purchases; in such cases, the terms of Section 6(% Back Benefit) and Section 7(Rewards Points and Redemption) below will apply, along with and notwithstanding any other terms and conditions also provided to govern such a % back benefit.

**4. How the Two Sets of Features of the Secured Card Work.** Secured Card accounts have two sets of features: the Secured Card features and the Store Card features. Each set of features has a different Purchase APR and Late Payment Fee as shown below and may have different rewards available.
  * The Secured Card features include a standard purchase APR of 10% and a Late Fee of $5. The Store Card features include a standard variable purchase APR of 29.99% and a Late Fee of up to $40. These APRs and fees are accurate as of 01/01/2025. The purchase APR under the Store Card features will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate, pursuant to your credit card agreement).
  * Upon approval for the Secured Card, you will only be able to activate the Secured Card features. To activate the Secured Card features, you will be required to provide Synchrony Bank with a security deposit, the amount of which will equal the credit limit on your Secured Card account.
  * After you have been an accountholder for 12 months, Synchrony Bank will consider whether you are eligible to opt in to activate the Store Card features of your account, based on specific eligibility criteria and your credit profile. If you are eligible, Amazon will notify you and provide you with important information to help you decide whether to retain the Secured Card features or convert to the Store Card features. The Store Card features do not require a security deposit, but have a higher Purchase APR and Late Payment Fee and may have different rewards.
  * If you choose to convert to the Store Card features: ✓ Your access to the Secured Card features will be permanently disabled.✓ Your security deposit will be returned, minus the amount needed to pay off any: (a) existing non-promotional balance, (b) expiring (within 2 months) deferred interest promotional balances and required payment due on an equal monthly payments balance, and (c) remaining minimum payment due on the account if not covered by (a) and (b) above✓ Synchrony Bank will provide you with a replacement card and card number to access the Store Card features. Your replacement card will be automatically added to your Amazon wallet.


**5. Updating from Amazon Store Card to the Prime Store Card or from the Amazon Secured Card to the Amazon Prime Secured Card.** At the time you become both (i) a cardholder of an Amazon Store Card or an Amazon Secured Card and (ii) a customer with an Eligible Prime Membership, your card will automatically be updated to the Prime Store Card or Amazon Prime Secured Card, respectively. “Eligible Prime Memberships” only apply to Amazon.com accounts (and not accounts on any other affiliated websites outside the U.S.) and may include, in Amazon’s sole discretion: annual and monthly Amazon Prime subscriptions and members of their Amazon Household (excluding Amazon Prime Video and invited guests of an Amazon Prime account), Amazon Prime Fresh, Amazon Family, Amazon Prime Student and trial memberships of Amazon Prime. The Prime Store Card and Amazon Prime Secured Card are governed by the same Synchrony Bank terms and privacy policy as Amazon Store Card and Amazon Secured Card, respectively. If you cease to be a customer with an Eligible Prime Membership, your Prime Store Card or Amazon Prime Secured Card, as the case may be, will be changed back to an Amazon Store Card or an Amazon Secured Card, respectively, without any change to the set of features applicable to your account. 
**6. % Back Benefit.** All purchases (less returns and other credits) to which the % back benefit applies, including eligible purchases at participating Whole Foods Markets, will result in your receiving rewards points equal to the applicable % of such purchases on your Store Card or Secured Card, as the case may be, except as provided below. We may, from time to time at our discretion, supplement the % back benefit by offering bonus rewards points for certain purchases. In such cases, the total rewards points offered for such purchases will be noted on the relevant product page or during checkout, and this section will apply to the % back benefit inclusive of any bonus rewards points. Prime Store Cardmembers with an eligible Prime Membership will default to the % back benefit on qualifying purchases. For all cards, any cardholder who wishes to apply an eligible promotional financing offer to their purchase must select that offer during checkout. The % back benefit cannot be combined with any special financing or equal monthly payments offer; you will have the option to apply either (a) any available special financing or equal monthly payments offer or (b) the % back benefit, but not both, to your purchase. We reserve the right to remove any person from the % back benefit in the event of any fraud or abuse in connection with the benefit. We reserve the right to discontinue or alter the terms of the % back benefit at any time subject to applicable law. Amazon Pay purchases made using your Prime Store Card or Amazon Prime Secured Card are not eligible to earn reward points.
**7. Rewards Points and Redemption.** You may see rewards points referred to simply as rewards and reflected as a dollar balance (versus a points balance), with $1 of rewards being equivalent to 1 rewards point. You may redeem your rewards points for eligible purchases at Amazon.com. Alternatively, you may also elect to either (a) redeem your rewards points as a one-time statement credit or (b) automatically redeem your available rewards points balance as a statement credit at the end of each subsequent billing cycle, in each case by visiting your Synchrony Bank online account management page ([www.syncbank.com/amazon](https://www.syncbank.com/amazon)) or by directly contacting Synchrony Bank. Your Store Card or Secured Card account must be open and in good standing to redeem rewards points and at the time any statement credit is posted to that account. Subject to Section 11, if your Store Card or Secured Card account is closed for any reason, including fraud or misuse of your Store Card or Secured Card account, you will forfeit any unredeemed rewards points. Please allow three (3) days, but in some unusual circumstances up to two billing cycles, (a) for your earned rewards points to be credited to your Store Card or Secured Card account and (b) if you elect to redeem your rewards points as a statement credit, for such statement credit to be applied to your Store Card or Secured Card account. If any of the products related to your original order are returned, subject to Amazon’s returns and refunds policies, you will receive any refund due to you by first refunding the amount charged to your card and, if any refund is still due, then by the return of rewards points. If a refund of your rewards points cannot be processed by Synchrony Bank for reasons including, but not limited to, closure of your Store Card or Secured Card account, then Amazon will issue an Amazon Gift Card to you for an amount equal to the value of the rewards points used towards your returned purchase. If you return a purchase made with rewards points, allow up to three (3) days, but in some unusual circumstances up to two billing cycles, for the value of the rewards points redeemed to be credited back to your account. 
**8. SPECIAL FINANCING AND EQUAL MONTHLY PAYMENTS:** These offers are subject to credit approval and can be selected at checkout on qualifying purchases
  * For Store Card accounts and Secured Card accounts that have converted to the Store Card features: The standard variable purchase APR is 29.99% and is accurate as of 01/01/2025 and will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate, pursuant to your credit card agreement. Minimum interest charge is $1.50.
  * For Secured Card accounts that have not converted to the Store Card features: The standard purchase APR is 10%. Minimum interest charge is $1.50.


When using a special financing or equal monthly payments offer, the entire purchase amount will be charged to your card when your order ships, but you will only need to make payments on that order according to the terms of the offer. Existing cardholders should see their credit card agreement for their applicable terms. 
We reserve the right to make special financing and/or equal monthly payments unavailable on any purchase at any time in our sole discretion; in such cases, and if special financing and/or equal monthly payments would otherwise have been available, we will notify you of such unavailability prior to or during checkout. We reserve the right to discontinue the special financing and equal monthly payments offers or alter the terms applicable thereto at any time. Equal monthly payments and special financing are not available at Whole Foods Market when paying in-store with the Store Card or Secured Card. 
**Special Financing Offers: No interest if paid in full within 6, 12 or 24 months.** Available using Store Card accounts, Secured Card accounts opened prior to January 1, 2021, and Secured Card accounts that have converted to the Store Card features (each, a "Special Financing-Enabled Card account’). Interest will be charged to your Special Financing-Enabled Card Account from the purchase date if the promotional balance is not paid in full within 6, 12 or 24 months respectively. Minimum monthly payments required. If products are eligible for a special financing offer, such eligibility, together with the applicable promotion length, will be noted during checkout. The special financing offer will apply to the qualifying product, and all other items in the same order, when payment is made using a Special Financing-Enabled Card account. No interest will be assessed on the promotional balance if you pay the promotional balance in full within the applicable promotional period. If you do not, interest will be assessed on the promotional balance from the date of the purchase. Promotional balance includes the purchase amount, taxes, shipping charges and any optional debt cancellation charges related to the relevant purchase. The subtotal, which excludes shipping, handling and taxes, is used in determining whether the applicable minimum purchase amounts shown above have been met. If Amazon-sold products are eligible for 24 months special financing, such designation will be noted during checkout. Special financing offers cannot be combined with any equal monthly payments offer or the % back benefit. If your purchase includes a recurring subscription, then the first month’s subscription fee (but not any subsequent monthly subscription fees) will also be included in the promotional purchase balance. Your first Subscribe and Save order using a Special Financing-Enabled Card Account is eligible for a special financing offer; subsequent Subscribe and Save orders are not. Depending on purchase amount, promotion length, and payment allocation, the required minimum monthly payments may or may not pay off the purchase by end of promotional period. Regular account terms apply to non-promotional purchases and, after this special financing promotion ends, to promotional purchases. Special financing offers are not available on Amazon Secured Card or Amazon Prime Secured Card accounts opened on or after January 1, 2021 while the Secured Card features are being accessed.
**Equal Monthly Payments offer: Pay for your purchase of eligible products with equal monthly payments and 0% APR.** Available using all Store Card accounts and Secured Card accounts (each, an "Equal Monthly Payments-Enabled Card Account"). No interest will be charged on the promotional purchase balance (which includes the purchase amount, taxes, shipping charges and any optional debt cancellation charges related to the relevant purchase) and equal monthly payments are required in the amount of the total initial promotional purchase (including the purchase amount, taxes and shipping charges) divided by the designated number of equal monthly payments, until the promotional balance is paid in full. If you do not make a required equal monthly payment on time, a late fee may be added to the minimum amount otherwise due on your Equal Monthly Payments-Enabled Card Account in the following billing cycle; such late fees will accrue interest at the applicable standard purchase APR listed above. If products are eligible for an equal monthly payments offer, such eligibility, together with the designated number of equal monthly payments, will be noted during checkout. The equal monthly payments offer will apply to the qualifying product, and all other items in the same order, when payment is made using an Equal Monthly Payments-Enabled Card Account. Optional debt cancellation charges will not be included in the calculation of the equal monthly payment, but such charges may require you to make payments for additional months. The equal monthly payment may be higher or lower than the minimum payment that would be required if the purchase was a non-promotional purchase. The equal monthly payment calculated will not be increased to but may be included in the minimum amount otherwise due on your account or will be added to your minimum payment for other balances on your account. Equal monthly payments offers cannot be combined with any special financing offer or the % back benefit. A monthly payment, if shown in advertising, should allow you to pay off the qualifying purchase (excluding taxes, shipping charges, or optional debt cancellation charges) within the promotional period if: (1) the purchase is and will be the only balance on the account during the promotional period (this means that you do not incur any additional fees or charges on your account and no other items are purchased with this order), (2) you make the payment by the due date each month, and (3) the purchase is subject to the equal monthly payments offer. Taxes and shipping charges imposed at checkout on this order will require you to make a higher monthly payment than shown. The monthly payment calculated for each equal monthly payments offer will be added to your minimum payment for other balances on your account, and will only apply if the equal monthly payments offer advertised is selected. Amazon may designate any product as eligible for an equal monthly payments offer, and may designate the number of equal monthly payments associated with such equal monthly payments offer, in its sole discretion. If your purchase includes a recurring subscription, then the first month’s subscription fee (but not any subsequent monthly subscription fees) will also be included in the promotional purchase balance.
**9. No Annual Fee.** There is no annual fee associated with a Store Card or Secured Card account. See the APR for new accounts at the beginning of Section 8 (SPECIAL FINANCING AND EQUAL MONTHLY PAYMENTS) above.
**10. Zero Fraud Liability.** You will not be held liable in the event of unauthorized use. You agree that unauthorized use does not include use by a person to whom you have given authority to use your Store Card or Secured Card account, as the case may be, and that you will be liable for all use by such a person.
**11. Change to Terms and Account Features.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may update or revise these terms or features of your account at any time. Use of your account or cards following any change constitutes acceptance of such change.
You will be notified of such changes (and, if applicable, provided a grace period) if required by applicable law. Not all changes require such a grace period, and we reserve the right to modify these terms without notice or any grace period in the case of suspected fraud or misuse regarding Store Card or Secured Card accounts. Notifications regarding a change to your account features or these terms will indicate if a grace period is applicable.
**12. Whole Foods Market In-Store Purchases.** Participating Whole Foods Market stores will accept in-store payment with the Store Card and Secured Card through the Amazon In-Store Code, available on the Amazon Shopping app or the Whole Foods Market app. Equal monthly payments and special financing are not available at Whole Foods Market when paying in-store with the Store Card or Secured Card. See [Store Card and Secured Cards are now accepted at Whole Foods Market ](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=121229522011)for complete terms and conditions.

[How customer reviews and ratings work](javascript:void\(0\))
Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.
To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzed reviews to verify trustworthiness.

##### HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE SO FAR!! DO NOT GET
THIS HAS BEEN A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE SO FAR. I DID NOT IN ANY MEANS NEED ANY CARDS. I HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY & 3 BANK CARDS THAT I CAN USE HOWEVER MY X TARNISHED MY CREDIT SO I RESEARCHED THAT THE FASTEST WAY TO GET YOUR CREDIT BACK IN GOOD STANDING WAS TO GET A SECURED CARD. AFTER LOOKING INTO THE OPTIONS OF THESE CARDS I DECIDED ON THIS ONE SINCE I SHOP ON HERE SO MUCH. SO AFTER A SHORT TIME I RECEIVED THE ENVELOPE THAT I KNEW THE CARD WAS IN HOWEVER NOT READY TO USE IT QUITE YET I DIDN'T OPEN IT YET BUT QUITE QUICKLY AFTER I RECEIVED A BILL FROM THEM!!! FOR MY PRIME MOVIE PACKAGE WHICH WAS $14.99 MONTH, PLUS THE ADDED MOVIE PACKAGES OF $6.99 PLUS $8.99!! WHICH I KNOW IN BY ACCOUNT ARE SELECTED AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST YEAR, TO BE PAID AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH MY BANK CARD!! I DID NOT GET THIS CARD TO PAY MY BILLS NOR DID I AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO CHARGE THEM TO IT AS IT WAS CLEARLY NOT SELECTED TO DO SO ON MY ACCOUNT!! & DID I MENTION NOT ONLY HAD THIS CARD NOT EVEN BEEN OPENED BUT I STILL HAD NO IDEA WHERE TO PAY IT PLUS MY MOVIE PACKAGE WAS SET UP WHERE THE 3 PACKAGES WERE SPREAD OUT OVER 1 MONTHS TIME SO WHERE THEY COULD AUTOMATICALLY TAKE EACH FROM MY BANK CARD AS NEEDED.. WITH THIS SECURED CARD IT HAD ALREADY MADE THE PAYMENT LATE AS THEY WAITED FOR ALL 3 TO BECOME DUE IN THE MONTHS TIME!! UNACCEPTABLE IN SO MANY WAYS!! I IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO CUSTOMER SERVICE CHAT FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD WHERE THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND MY ISSUES...I WANTED THEM TO REFUND THAT CARD!! I TOLD THEM I WOULD STILL PAY BUT ON MY PAYMENT METHOD ON RECORD!!! IT TOOK A LOT OF ARGUING FOR THEM TO FINALLY AGREE BUT THEY ONLY WANTED TO PAY $6.99!! I REFUSED!! I TOLD THEM ABSOLUTELY NOT!! THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE $30.97!! FINALLY BEGRUDGINGLY THEY ACCEPTED AFTER I READ OFF THE ACCOUNT # ON THE CARD AND EACH TRANSCRIPTION # OVER & OVER AGAIN TO THEM... AND I TOLD THEM NEVER TO DO THIS AGAIN BECAUSE AS IT IS MARKED, LISTED & SHOWS & HAS BEEN THE PROCESS FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO FUTURE PAYMENTS FOR MY PRIME MOVIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE UNLESS I SELECT IT NEED TO BE GOING TO MY PAYMENT ON RECORD. THEY AGREED.... WELL...I JUST GOT ANOTHER BILL AND SUPER SUPER LATE... TURNS OUT THEY DIDN'T REFUND ALL OF THAT FIRST ORDER. THEY MISSED $8.99 OF IT & THERE'S NOW 2 MONTHS MORE OF MY PRIME MOVIE PACKAGES ON IT!!! AND LATE FEES!!! SO A CARD I GOT TO REPAIR MY CREDIT IS MAKING IT WORSE, THEY'RE TAKING THE $ I PUT ON IN LATE FEES THAT THEY ARE SCAMMING OFF ME BUT GOING AGAINST THE RULES OF THEIR SITE (USING A NON AUTHORIZED PAYMENT METHOD) & I'M NOT ONLY GOING TO CANCEL THIS CARD BUT I'M GOING TO CANCEL ALL SERVICES WITH THEM WHICH IS CLOSE TO $60 MONTH WITHOUT COUNTING EVERYTHING I PURCHASE SO YES THIS CARD IS A JOKE & THEY'LL FIND A WAY TO TAKE YOUR MONEY & MAKE YOUR CREDIT WORSE. BEWARE!! MISSS.D

Card and account work great. I make a lot of purchases on Amazon and this card allows me to not only build my credit, but gives me the ability to try out an Amazon card with a limit I set. If I was to get a credit credit card... I wo I ld probably be giving Amazon all the money back ok the card. I like the experience with the Amazon card. Notifications come on time, I can sync it to real time data which save me and keeps me on task quicker while I'm shopping. The card works great and I recommend getting it while you build or rebuild...

So far so good. I love the app. I love the fact that I was given the opportunity to have a secured card since my credit score wasn’t so good for an unsecured card. Everything has been really good. I’ve made one payment so far and it’s very easy on the app. I am looking forward to establishing good credit with Amazon. I also like the fact that they let you pick how much money you want to put in your card to open it. With good credit habits hopefully I will be given an unsecured card in the future. I also like on the app that it lets you request a credit increase. No searching all over the app or having to call to request a credit increase. Thank you Amazon!

I obtained my Amazon Secured card around this time last year and was excited at the chance to show I am responsible when paying my bills and with the hopes of increasing my credit and being able to move up to a non-secured card, so I was very careful on how I used my card and paid my payments on time. I really liked the option of the installment plan on certain purchases. Every month I paid my balance off even if I had a installment plan , I would normally go ahead and pay that off in full early. I checked my account religiously and can see every month what I owed and the amount I paid. Like I said I usually just paid it off in full every month, well coming up on about 9 months of having the card I checked my account and it says I have no credit available? I called Synchrony bank and I was told very unprofessionally and rudely that I had 2 payments that bounced. One back in July and another in January, well first off I never made payments by check. I always had it debited from my bank. Never once did I have a returned payment charge and looking at my payment history never once did it show a negative balance caused by a returned payment starting from July where she was very nasty with me why would they keep taking my payments and give me credit back for spending. It shows consistant payments they accepted, never giving me a notice or fee my card worked from July when she said my payment was returned. For 8 months I paid on time and nothing was brought to my attention, so clearly there are other reasons they chose to just up and close my account. If I had 2 payments that were returned then why was my full security deposit returned to me. You think if the bank says you owe them for 2 payments they would have deducted their money from my deposit, right. That's logical thinking or charge me ISF fee for July and January. I called my bank and went over my statements and clearly saw the payments were processed through to Synchrony bank. They have alterial motives for not even notifying me they closed my account. I believe due to making payments in full each month even on installment plans they weren't making any money off of me because when you pay in full every month they can't charge interest. I could be wrong, but that is what banks do make money off of people with a credit card by charging interest, hoping you only make a minimums payment. I was of no use to them, so they lied and closed my card when I did nothing but pay my bill in full every month. What ever you do don't get a credit card with Synchrony bank behind it because they will find a way to screw you. They are being fraudulent by stating I had 2 payment returned when they were not and that's a fact., because they would of slapped me with a fee and it would show that I owed a double payment next billing period. They did me wrong and I'll never do business with them anymore. They are not honest very unethical in their practices when dealing with consumers, I'm going to find out my legal rights and contact Consumer Law and report them to every business that deals with financial institutions that are in the wrong, by law. I have my proof I paid. Discrimination I'll start off with. STAY AWAY FROM THEM. BEWARE!!

I was approved and the money I deposited was available immediately which was great. But I had wanted to put more money down to increase my limit the following week and I couldn’t. I had to wait to become eligible to increase the limit. Granted that was my misunderstanding since I’ve never had a secured credit card. It’s been over a year now and I’m still not eligible to get the Amazon store credit card. Basically was the only reason I got the secured card. Since I do shop here I’ll keep it and hopefully I’ll be able to the regular credit card one day. But otherwise it’s a credit card and if you aren’t maxing it out, it can potentially help your credit score. I wish the payments would process faster. Takes about 3 days.

I loved my card! But the drawback in making a payment was it took 2-3 business days for the payment to be taken and I leave my card locked so never knowing exactly when they would deduct my payment caused me to lose my card.

Decent card! Like most credit cards , synchrony though ESPECIALLY! The system does not effectively, or speedy payment handling process! I have waited almost five business days for my payment i set up over the app , payable through my linked bank account. I am not rich . So when I set up a payment on the app for date June 9th 2025. There is no reason why the funds are not getting pulled until minimum June 12-13th.. I am hoping after the six months that I will get offered a normal Amazon credit card. I really enjoy earning 2% rewards! The credit card only works in the Amazon app or website. When I attempted to use this card at Whole Foods (. ) bc I was told when signing up that my secure credit card with work at all Amazon branded store and apps. They misgave me the incorrect info. I can use my credit card at Whole Foods only when I have the secured Amazon card linked to my Amazon pay and use the QR code picture on my phone to have my saved payment method pull up and select the secured credit card out of your stored payment methods .
