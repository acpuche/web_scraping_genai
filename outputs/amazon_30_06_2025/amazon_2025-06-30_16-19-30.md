[How customer reviews and ratings work](javascript:void\(0\))
Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.
To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzed reviews to verify trustworthiness.

This helps to increase credit score. Be responsible. When use you get real rewards points. Why AmEx rewards are deference from other cards. AmEx rewards you can use to buy anything from Amazon some other cards rewards is just an eye wash. In AmEx card APR may be little high. Still worth having, because of the other benefits. If you are not responsible for what your barrow, please don't get an AmEx card because your irresponsibility will affect all the other AmEx card users.

As a business owner , I cringe when I open a card and they give you a 5 thousand or low credit limit , knowing that the card is useless to the business. I appreciate that this Amazon american express card gave a very nice high limit that I can actually purchase material and not have to worry about hitting the limit. This helps the business . Thanks!

This card is excellent. I have no complaints. I just wish people wouldn't try to use it without my consent a lot. It as a chip in it but there needs to be an RFD blocked so those who are not sincere cannot attempt to charge it. I figured out a solution, but it is a card that people can charge even online without first seeking my approval to confirm purchase. I spent a lot of time disputing transactions that I never used that card for.

I’ve been using the Amazon Business American Express Card for several months now, and it has become an essential tool for managing business expenses, especially with our frequent Amazon purchases. Here’s why I highly recommend it:Key Benefits for BusinessesThe standout feature of this card is the ability to choose between 3% back on Amazon purchases or opting for 90-day interest-free payment terms on purchases. This flexibility is a game changer, especially if you're managing cash flow for a business. For larger orders or high-ticket items, the 90-day payment terms offer breathing room, while the 3% back is a solid return on everyday supplies.No Annual FeeUnlike many business credit cards, this one comes with no annual fee, making it even more appealing for small and medium-sized businesses. You get premium benefits without the overhead of annual fees, which adds significant value over time.Rewards Beyond AmazonWhile the card shines with Amazon purchases, it’s also versatile outside of Amazon. You can earn 2% back at restaurants, gas stations, and wireless telephone services. For a business, these categories cover a good chunk of typical expenses, which adds even more reward potential. Additionally, you earn 1% back on all other purchases, so no spending goes unrewarded.Smooth Integration with Amazon BusinessThis card integrates seamlessly with Amazon Business accounts, making it easier to track and manage expenses. The itemized purchases are well-organized, which is great for bookkeeping and accounting, and you can even assign cards to employees with spend controls for greater oversight.Easy Application and Excellent Customer ServiceApplying for the card was straightforward, and I was impressed by how quickly the process went. The credit limit was generous, and American Express customer service has been stellar. Any issues or questions I’ve had were addressed promptly, which I’ve come to expect from American Express.Security and Peace of MindAs with all Amex cards, the purchase protection and extended warranty benefits give me peace of mind. Knowing that I’m protected in case of damaged or defective items is reassuring, especially for larger business purchases. The card also comes with fraud protection, which is essential for business transactions.Pros:3% cash back or 90-day interest-free payment option on Amazon Business and AWS purchasesNo annual fee2% cash back on common business expenses (restaurants, gas, wireless services)Seamless integration with Amazon Business accountsPurchase protection and extended warranty benefitsCons:The 3% back only applies to Amazon Business and AWS purchases, so if your business doesn’t frequently shop on Amazon, the full benefit may not be realized.The rewards rate on non-Amazon purchases (1%) is less competitive compared to some other cards on the market.Final Thoughts:If your business makes regular purchases on Amazon or AWS, the Amazon Business American Express Card is a no-brainer. Between the cash back rewards, flexible payment options, and integration with Amazon’s business platform, it’s an excellent choice. Even if you don’t make a ton of Amazon purchases, the additional rewards categories and no annual fee make this card a solid option for day-to-day business spending. I highly recommend it for businesses of all sizes.

Great but initial agreement not clear that net90 still requires a min $45 per month payment. To know this you have to click on a link within the initial agreement then click on another link in the linked document them click on a link in that document to see that there is a $45 min monthly payment even on NET90.

##### [ _5.0 out of 5 stars_ Amazon Business Prime AX Card is a fantastic option! ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YFP5VOD6AX4L/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07984JN3L)
Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2025

I’ve been using the Amazon Business Prime American Express Card mostly for my Amazon purchases, and it’s been a great fit for my business. The 5% cashback on U.S. purchases at Amazon.com, Amazon Business, AWS, and Whole Foods Market (up to $120,000 per year) is a fantastic perk, putting money back in my pocket for things I’m already buying, like office supplies and tech. The cashback feels like a nice bonus for sticking with Amazon. What I really love is the flexibility to choose 90-day interest-free terms instead of rewards when I need to manage cash flow—it’s a lifesaver for those months when I want to delay payments without worrying about interest. The card has no annual fee, which is a plus, though I need to keep my Amazon Prime membership active (starting at $69/year for Business Prime). Since most of my spending is on Amazon, I don’t use the 2% back on restaurants, gas, or wireless services much, but it’s nice to know it’s there. Overall, the card’s rewards and repayment options make it a reliable tool for my business, much like the excellent service I value in other areas.
